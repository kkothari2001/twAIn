I saw a small girl in the boat run toward him, with a little boy by her
hand, who looked to be about twelve or threescore years of age. He had a
large, dark complexion, and his brown eyes were very well
pigmented. He spoke very little, and said nothing to the
captain.

“Ah,” said the captain, “that’s what you’ll call a good boy.”

“What do you say?” asked the boy.

“I’ll take him along with the rest of the crew to find the treasure.”

The boy’s face brightened again and he ran toward the captain.

But as he passed the captain, he lost sight of him, and as he went on
running, the captain turned to look at the little girl. The girl
was playing with the little boy in the boat, and she was making
her way toward the treasure when she was suddenly carried away along the
water by the wind.

“What was that?” asked the captain.
